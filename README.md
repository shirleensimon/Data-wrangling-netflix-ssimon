## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Kaggle environment

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Install the required packages:

-pandas
-numpy
-jupyter
-matplotlib
-seaborn


Launch the notebook:

jupyter notebook notebooks/netflix-shirleen.ipynb


✅ Output
cleaned_netflix.csv: The final cleaned dataset ready for EDA or modeling.

📌 Future Work
